   <h2>Boss</h2>
    <ul>
     <p>Where Astro Bot Rescue Mission has surpassed Super Mario Oddysey is in bosses. There are only six of them, including the final one, but all are unique and effective. Each has three phases, as we are used to from childhood. However, there is no story behind the bosses, so you don't really empathize with them. And there is no plot in the game as such, so it feels like pure fun, a riot of game mechanics and an emotional feast. So God be with them, with teeth and eyes, the main thing is that it should be fun</p>    </ul>
